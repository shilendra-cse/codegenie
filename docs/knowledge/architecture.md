# hobai Architecture

> Status: **Accepted** (MVP) · Last updated: 2026-10-30

hobai is a web-based autonomous coding agent. A user connects their GitHub repositories, assigns a task (a prompt for the MVP; Jira and Notion later), and the agent completes it inside an isolated cloud sandbox and delivers the result as a pull request.

## 1. Decisions

| # | Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Sandbox provider | **E2B**, behind a `Sandbox` interface; Daytona kept as an alternative | Full internet on every plan (Daytona's network limit broke installs like Prisma's engines), pay-as-you-go at the same price per hour. Interface keeps the vendor swappable; a `DockerSandbox` serves local dev. ([sandbox.md](./sandbox.md) §8) |
| D2 | Where the agent loop runs | **In our worker**, tools execute remotely in the sandbox | LLM keys, DB and Redis never enter the sandbox; run state survives sandbox failure; trivial event streaming. |
| D3 | GitHub access | **One GitHub App** for sign-in (its OAuth) and repo access (its installations); GitHub-only sign-in for the MVP | Per-repo consent, 1-hour tokens scoped to one repo and minimal permissions, bot identity on commits/PRs, webhooks; one registration and one identity. |
| D4 | Run execution | **BullMQ** on Redis, dedicated `apps/worker` process | Already have Redis; durable queue, retries, concurrency control, stalled-job detection. |
| D5 | Live updates | Worker → Redis pub/sub + `run_events` table → server **SSE** → browser | Replayable (refresh mid-run works), auditable, simple. |
| D6 | Delivery | Worker (not the agent) commits through GitHub's API and opens the PR. **Draft PR** if checks fail, ready PR if they pass. Never the default branch. | Model can't push half-done work; no write token ever enters the sandbox; commits show as verified. |
| D7 | Autonomy | Fire-and-forget to PR. Plan-approval step is a **post-MVP** per-task toggle. | Keep MVP flow minimal. |
| D8 | Sandbox lifetime | **One sandbox per run, deleted at the end.** Pause/resume for follow-ups is post-MVP. | Cost and simplicity. |
| D9 | LLM | Provider-agnostic via **Vercel AI SDK**; platform-controlled model from a **catalog** (prices, context window), selected by env (`AGENT_MODEL`); currently `gpt-6-luna` | Avoid lock-in; predictable cost; pick models by eval results. See [agent.md](./agent.md). |
| D10 | Hosting | **Vercel** (web) + one **VPS with Coolify** (api, worker) + **Neon** (Postgres) + **Upstash** (Redis) | Fixed, low cost at MVP scale; the database and Redis are managed (backups, no upkeep), so the VPS holds no data and can be rebuilt. See §10. |
| D11 | Domains & auth cookies | Custom domain; web at `app.`, API proxied via Next.js rewrite (`/api/*` → api service) | Single browser origin: no third-party-cookie or CORS problems with Better Auth. |
| D12 | Task intake | All sources normalize to one `Task`; MVP = prompt only, then Jira, then Notion | Pipeline is source-agnostic; integrations are adapters. |
| D13 | Task vs Run | A **task** owns conversation, branch and PR; a **run** is one attempt at it | Follow-ups and PR-comment replies reuse the task's branch/PR without run chains. |
| D14 | Project ownership | Single-user projects for MVP | Team/org access can be added later without schema changes to existing tables. |

### Monorepo layout

```
apps/
  web/        Next.js UI
  server/     Express API (auth, REST, SSE, webhooks) — never touches sandboxes
  worker/     BullMQ consumer: calls the runner for queued runs
  cli/        local dev harness: calls the runner, prints events
  evals/      eval tasks for the agent and the harness that runs them
  e2e/        the end-to-end test: the whole journey in Playwright, run on demand (web.md §19)
packages/
  runner/     runs a task end to end: checkout → setup → agent → verify → deliver (no AI logic)
  agent/      AI only: LLM loop, model catalog, prompt, sandbox-backed tools
  sandbox/    Sandbox interface + DockerSandbox, E2BSandbox, DaytonaSandbox
  github/     GitHub App: repo-scoped installation tokens, bot identity, webhook signatures (github.md)
  db/         Postgres schema, client and migrations (Drizzle), shared by server and worker
  terminal/   terminal output for the CLI and evals
  shared/     types shared across apps and packages (API, events, setup), and the brand (@hobai/shared/brand)
docs/
  api/        OpenAPI spec
  knowledge/  architecture, design and feature docs
```

Dependencies point one way: `runner → agent, sandbox, shared`; `agent → sandbox, shared`; `sandbox → shared`; `db → shared`; `terminal → shared`. Apps: `server → db, github, shared`; `worker → runner, agent, sandbox, db, github, shared`; `cli → runner, agent, terminal, shared`; `evals → runner, agent, sandbox, terminal, shared`; `web → shared`. Apps never import from other apps, except `e2e`, which drives the worker in-process.

**The brand lives in one place.** `@hobai/shared/brand` exports the product name (`hobai`), the short name (`hobai`) and the domain. UI copy, error messages, prompts and the PR footer use the product name; the identifiers built from the short name (branch prefix, sandbox image, snapshot and label, `/tmp/hobai`, the CLI home and `HOBAI_HOME`, the queue, the localStorage prefix, test prefixes) build it rather than write it out. Files that can't import TypeScript write it out: package names, `docker-compose.yml`, `ci.yml`, `script/*.sh`, `.env.example`, the sandbox Dockerfile (including the bot git identity `hobai <bot@hobai.app>`) and the docs.

**`packages/db` rules.** The server and the worker both use the database directly (the server writes rows and enqueues; the worker updates runs and writes events), so the schema lives in one shared package instead of inside one app:
- **all data access lives here:** schema, client, migrations and every query (`src/queries/`, one folder per domain, mirroring `src/schema/`). Apps call query functions and never build queries; ESLint enforces it (`@hobai/db/eslint`). Queries hold no business rules: they report what happened, and the app decides what it means;
- migrations run from one place, never inside an app: `pnpm migrate` in development, and in production the server container runs `dist/migrate.js` just before the server starts (§10); the worker never migrates;
- the connection is created by each app (`createDb(url)` with its own config), never on import.
A schema change can mean redeploying both apps; that comes from sharing the database, not from the package. The old `apps/agent` REPL is replaced by `apps/cli`. Details: [runner.md](./runner.md), [agent.md](./agent.md), [sandbox.md](./sandbox.md).

## 3. Components

### apps/web
Pages: sign-in, connect GitHub (App install), repo picker, project view (tasks/runs history), new task, live run view (event timeline, tool calls, streamed summary, PR link). Talks only to `/api/*` (same origin via rewrite).

### apps/server
- Better Auth (GitHub sign-in through the App, sessions).
- GitHub App ([github.md](./github.md) §6): install callback, webhook receiver with signature verification and delivery dedupe (`installation`, `installation_repositories`, `pull_request` → task status; `pull_request_review_comment`, `issue_comment` later), repo picker API (installations and their repositories, through the user's token).
- REST: projects, environments (and restore), branches, onboarding, tasks, runs (diff, cancel), GitHub. Full list: [api.md](./api.md) §4.
- SSE, replay + live: `GET /api/runs/:id/events` and `GET /api/projects/:id/onboarding/events`.
- Task follow-ups (`POST /api/tasks/:id/messages`) are post-MVP.
- Writes rows and enqueues; does no long-running work.

### apps/worker
Consumes the BullMQ queue `hobai-work` and runs the pipeline in §5. Details and commands: [apps/worker/README.md](../../apps/worker/README.md).

- **Work kinds:** `run-task { runId }` (one run of a task) and `onboard-project { onboardingId }` (one setup of a project's environment, recorded in `onboardings`; [environment.md](./environment.md) §3.5). A setup's events are stored in `onboarding_events` and published live on `onboarding:{id}`; a failed setup fails its queue item, and the reaper ends setups whose worker is gone, as it does for runs.
- **Concurrency:** `WORKER_CONCURRENCY` items at once per process (default 3), each in its own sandbox; more throughput means more processes.
- **Cancellation:** a queued run is marked `cancelled` in the database, and the worker skips it. A running one gets a `run-cancel` message carrying its id; every worker process hears it, and the one running it aborts the run's signal.
- **No retries:** an item whose worker died is failed when BullMQ detects it as stalled, never run again (the agent may already have pushed or spent money). A worker renews its items' locks while it works; a lock lasts 2 minutes, so a short Redis outage doesn't look like a dead worker.
- **Reaper:** a `reap` work item, every 5 minutes (one BullMQ job scheduler shared by all workers) and at startup. It fails runs nothing will finish: `running` with no active queue item (`worker_lost`), or `queued` for over 15 minutes with the item gone (`lost_in_queue`), adding `error` + `done` events. For a `worker_lost` run it first saves the diff from its sandbox and parks the sandbox (Daytona: stopped, kept 4 h for a future resume; E2B and Docker: deleted).
- **Shutdown:** the first SIGINT/SIGTERM stops taking work and waits for the work in progress. Repeated SIGTERMs are ignored (a deploy's hard stop is Docker's SIGKILL at the end of the grace period, §10); only a second Ctrl-C, a second or more later, exits at once and leaves the rest to the reaper. An unhandled promise rejection is logged, not fatal, so one stray error doesn't end every run in progress.
- **Health:** `GET /health` on `WORKER_HEALTH_PORT` (default 4100, inside the container only) answers 200 while Postgres and Redis answer.
- **Time limits:** a run stops at 45 minutes and a setup at 45 minutes, waiting for answers included (why: §10). Commands can't be interrupted, so the limit is checked before each one starts. A run that reaches it before the agent fails (`time_limit`); after that the agent stops as incomplete, checks not yet run are skipped, and the work goes out as a draft PR. A setup that reaches it fails (`TIME_LIMIT`).
- **Clone:** with a read token for the project's repository from the GitHub App, passed only to the clone command ([github.md](./github.md) §7).

### packages/agent
Details: **[agent.md](./agent.md)**.

`runAgent({ runId, task, ctx, model, limits, emit, signal })` → `AgentResult`. `ctx` carries the sandbox and check commands; `model` is a resolved catalog entry. Tools are thin wrappers over `Sandbox`; never touch the host filesystem.

### packages/sandbox
```ts
interface Sandbox {
  readonly id: string;
  exec(command: string, options?: { cwd?: string; timeoutMs?: number; env?: Record<string, string> }):
    Promise<{ exitCode: number; stdout: string; stderr: string; timedOut: boolean; truncated: boolean }>;
  readFile(path: string): Promise<string>;
  writeFile(path: string, content: string): Promise<void>;
  listFiles(path: string, options?: { maxDepth?: number }): Promise<FileEntry[]>;
  destroy(): Promise<void>;
}
```
Implementations: `E2BSandbox` (prod), `DaytonaSandbox` (alternative), `DockerSandbox` (dev/tests). Selected by `SANDBOX_PROVIDER=e2b|daytona|docker`.

E2B sandboxes are created from the **`hobai-base` template** (`pnpm sandbox:build-template`), Daytona's from the **`hobai-base` snapshot** (`pnpm sandbox:build-snapshot`), both built from the same Dockerfile as the Docker image. Every sandbox is labelled `hobai=1` plus `kind` and `runId` / `projectId`. E2B kills a sandbox after 1 hour whatever happens; Daytona's have a 2-hour TTL and auto-stop as safety nets. Details: [sandbox.md](./sandbox.md) §7 (Daytona) and §8 (E2B).

## 4. Flows

### 4.1 Connect GitHub (one-time)
1. User signs in with GitHub OAuth (identity only).
2. "Connect repositories" → `github.com/apps/<app>/installations/new` → user selects repos.
3. Callback with `installation_id` → server stores `github_installations` row; `installation` webhook confirms.
4. Repo picker lists repos accessible to the user's installations. Choosing one creates a `project`.

For any repo access, the server/worker signs a JWT with the App private key and exchanges it for an **installation token** scoped to that repo (~1h TTL). No long-lived repo credentials are stored.

### 4.2 Create a task
```
POST /api/projects/:id/tasks { prompt, baseBranch? }
  authorize user owns project
  409 if the GitHub App is uninstalled or suspended on the project's account
  409 if the project has no environment, or its environment needs attention
  tx: insert task(source=prompt) + message(role=user) + run(trigger=initial, status=queued)
  queue.add("run-task", { runId }, { jobId: runId })     // idempotent
    queue down → run marked failed (queue_unavailable) → 503 QUEUE_UNAVAILABLE
  → 201 { task, run }
```
Client opens the SSE stream for `run.id`.

### 4.3 Live events
```
worker emit(e):   INSERT run_events  +  PUBLISH run:{runId}
server SSE:       SUBSCRIBE first → replay run_events after Last-Event-ID → forward live (dedupe by id)
                  heartbeat 15s; close on done/error
```
Events are keyed by (`run_id`, `seq`); `seq` is the SSE event id. High-frequency `text_delta` and `agent_step` events are published live only, never stored.

### 4.4 Follow-ups
- **UI follow-up message** (post-MVP: `POST /api/tasks/:id/messages`) → new run on the same task with `trigger=follow_up`; checks out the task's branch, receives the previous run's summary + new instruction, pushes to the same PR.
- **PR review comment / `@hobai` mention** (webhook, deduped via `webhook_deliveries`) → new run on the task with `trigger=pr_comment`; context includes comment, file and line.
- **Jira (post-MVP)** → webhook on assignment/label → Task → run; PR link posted back to the ticket.

Every entry point reduces to **task → new run**.

---

## 5. Run pipeline (worker)

| Stage | Actions | Events |
|---|---|---|
| **Prepare** | load run/task/project; `status=running`; mint installation token; create the sandbox; persist `sandboxId`. Alongside, on a task's first run, the model writes its short title ([agent.md](./agent.md) §10) | `sandbox_created`, `task_titled` |
| **Checkout** | shallow clone of the base branch into `/workspace` (later runs will check out `task.branch_name`) | |
| **Setup** | replay the project's environment config (setup steps), then run every check once as a baseline; the config is created once per repository by environment onboarding ([environment.md](./environment.md)) | `setup_started`, `setup_completed` |
| **Agent** | run agent loop (§6) | `tool_start`, `tool_end`, `text_delta`, `agent_step` |
| **Verify** | run lint + tests; on failure with budget left, feed failures back into the agent | `checks_completed` |
| **Deliver** | no diff → finish with explanation, no PR. Else the runner lists the changes and the worker commits them through GitHub's API as the App on `hobai/<title slug>-<taskId prefix>` and opens the PR (draft if checks failed or incomplete) with summary + checks + changed files ([github.md](./github.md) §8) | `branch_created`, `git_push`, `pr_opened` |
| **Finally** | persist summary & usage; `status=succeeded/failed/cancelled`; **always** destroy sandbox | `done` / `error` |

The clone token is passed to git through that command's environment rather than stored in `.git/config`; no write token enters the sandbox.

---

## 6. Agent loop

**Context:** system rules (stay in `/workspace`, don't touch `.git` internals, verify before finishing) + repo context (depth-limited tree, README excerpt, `AGENTS.md`, detected commands) + normalized task.

**Tools:**

| Tool | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `list_files(path, depth)` | tree, ignores `node_modules`, `.git`, build output |
| `read_file(path, startLine?, endLine?)` | line-numbered, size-capped |
| `search(pattern, glob?)` | ripgrep `file:line: text`, capped |
| `edit_file(path, old, new)` | `old` must match exactly once, else error with hint |
| `write_file(path, content)` | create / full rewrite |
| `bash(cmd, timeoutMs?)` | anything else, cwd `/workspace` |
| `run_checks()` | detected lint + test commands, condensed failures |
| `finish_task(title?, summary)` | ends loop; title becomes the commit subject and PR title, summary the PR body |

**Rules:**
- Loop ends only on `finish_task` or a limit — not when the model stops calling tools.
- Tool output truncated head+tail with an "N lines omitted" marker.
- At ~70% of the context window, older tool results are summarized; task, plan and recent turns kept.
- Limits per run: `maxSteps` (~150), `maxWallTime` (~30 min, or less when the whole run's 45 minutes run out first), `maxCostUsd`. On limit: force a summary, deliver as draft PR marked incomplete.
- Cancellation via `AbortSignal`, checked every step.
- Message history uses the SDK's native tool messages (`response.messages`), never synthetic user/assistant turns.

---

## 7. Data model

Full design: **[database.md](./database.md)**. Summary:

- **Task** = unit of work (conversation, branch, PR). **Run** = one agent execution on a task. Follow-ups and PR-comment responses are new runs on the same task.
- Tables: Better Auth (`user`, `session`, `account`, `verification`), `github_installations`, `webhook_deliveries`, `projects`, `project_environments`, `onboardings`, `onboarding_events`, `tasks`, `messages`, `runs`, `run_events`, `run_diffs`.
- A partial unique index allows at most one queued/running run per task.
- `run_events` keyed by (`run_id`, `seq`) for gap-free SSE replay.
- Migrations live in `packages/db/drizzle`.

Removed from server: `WORKSPACES_ROOT`, `lib/workspaces.ts`, OAuth-token GitHub service (replaced by App tokens), unused JWT/bcrypt config.

---

## 8. Failure handling

| Failure | Handling |
|---|---|
| Worker crash mid-run | The item is failed when BullMQ detects it as stalled (its lock ran out: up to 2 minutes; `maxStalledCount: 0`, never retried). Within 5 minutes (or at the next worker start) the reaper saves the run's diff, parks its sandbox and fails the run with `worker_lost`. E2B and Docker sandboxes are deleted when parked; Daytona deletes a parked sandbox after `SANDBOX_RETENTION_HOURS`. |
| Sandbox create fails | Retry with backoff (nothing has happened yet). |
| Dependency install fails | Continue; agent is told setup failed and may fix it. |
| LLM error / rate limit | Backoff retry inside loop; fail after N attempts. |
| User cancels | `POST /api/runs/:id/cancel`: a queued run is marked `cancelled` directly; a running one gets a `run-cancel` message → abort signal → sandbox destroyed → `cancelled`. |
| Delivery refused (branch exists, permissions, mismatch) | `deliver_failed` with the reason; the diff stays saved on the run. |

---

## 9. Security

- Untrusted code runs **only** in cloud sandboxes (E2B, or Daytona); never on our servers.
- Sandbox receives only a repo-scoped, ~1h installation token, only for the run's duration.
- Secret placement:

| Secret | web | api | worker | sandbox |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Better Auth secret, OAuth client creds | – | ✓ | – | – |
| GitHub App private key | – | ✓ | ✓ | – |
| GitHub webhook secret | – | ✓ | – | – |
| `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL` | – | ✓ | ✓ | – |
| E2B (or Daytona) API key | – | – | ✓ | – |
| LLM API key | – | – | ✓ | – |
| Installation token (repo-scoped, 1h) | – | – | – | ✓ |

- Webhook signatures verified; production refuses to boot with default secrets.
- Agent never pushes to the default branch; one active run per task (enforced by a DB index).
- Per-user limits from the plan (free: 1 task at once, 10 runs a cycle) and a global daily spend cap, enforced at task creation ([billing.md](./billing.md) §2).
- Full audit trail in `run_events`.

---

## 10. Deployment

| Component | Host | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| web | Vercel | `/api/*` rewrite to the api (SSE buffering disabled) |
| api | VPS, Coolify app (Docker) | public behind Coolify's proxy (Traefik, HTTPS); migrations run before it starts |
| worker | VPS, Coolify app (Docker) | no public port; scale with BullMQ concurrency |
| Postgres | Neon | managed, backups; the **direct** connection string for both apps and migrations: about 40 connections at most (a pool of 20 per app), well inside Neon's limit, and no pooler to work around |
| Redis | Upstash | TCP over TLS (`rediss://`), which BullMQ and pub/sub need; eviction off (`noeviction`) so jobs are never dropped |
| Sandboxes | E2B (`SANDBOX_PROVIDER=e2b`) | `hobai-base` template built by script (`pnpm sandbox:build-template`) |
| GitHub App | GitHub | separate dev and prod Apps |

**VPS:** Hostinger KVM 2 (2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 100 GB NVMe), Ubuntu 24.04 with Coolify. It runs only the api and the worker; untrusted code never runs there (sandboxes are on E2B), and it stores no data, so it can be rebuilt from the repo and its secrets.

**Proxies:** a request passes Vercel's rewrite, then Cloudflare, then Coolify's Traefik, so production sets `TRUST_PROXY=3` (checked at deploy: the rate limits must see the visitor's address). The `api` DNS record is proxied by Cloudflare (SSL mode Full (strict), Traefik's Let's Encrypt certificate at the origin): when Vercel connected to the VPS directly, some of its reused connections were silently dropped between Vercel and Hostinger, and random API calls failed with 502 `ROUTER_EXTERNAL_TARGET_CONNECTION_ERROR` while the VPS itself was healthy.

**If the VPS goes down:** no data is lost (it lives in Neon and Upstash); the web still loads but API calls fail; queued tasks wait in Upstash and the worker picks them up when it's back; runs in progress are lost (resuming them is post-MVP). Coolify runs on the same box, so it can't help here: it reads container logs live and doesn't keep them. Two outside services cover this:
- **Logs off the box:** container logs are shipped to a hosted log service (Better Stack or Axiom, free tier), so the logs from before a crash can be read while the VPS is down.
- **Uptime check:** an outside monitor (Better Stack or UptimeRobot, free tier) calls the api's health endpoint every minute and alerts by email.

Coolify stays on the VPS rather than on a laptop: running it elsewhere doesn't keep logs either, and it would lose deploy on push (GitHub can't reach a laptop).

**Things to watch:**
- Upstash bills per command on pay-as-you-go, and an idle BullMQ worker still sends commands (blocking waits, stalled-job checks, the reap scheduler). Check the daily count after deploy and move to a fixed-price plan if it's high.
- Neon's free tier suspends an idle database; the first query after a pause takes a moment longer. Fine at MVP scale.

### Images
One Dockerfile per app (`apps/server/Dockerfile`, `apps/worker/Dockerfile`), built from the repository root:
1. **build:** installs the app and its workspace packages, then bundles them with tsup into `dist/` (the `@/…` aliases and our packages, which ship TypeScript, are bundled; npm packages aren't). The server's build copies `packages/db/drizzle` into `dist/drizzle`.
2. **deps:** installs only the app's runtime npm packages, all hoisted to the top so the bundle finds those of our packages too. `--no-optional` leaves out `next` and `react`, which reach the server as optional peers of `better-auth` (shared with the web app).
3. **image:** `node:24-slim` with `node_modules`, `package.json` and `dist/` only, running as the `node` user, with `node` as the main process so it receives Docker's SIGTERM itself. The server runs `dist/migrate.js` and then `exec`s `dist/index.js`, with `HOST=0.0.0.0`.

Both have a Docker health check (`/health`, the worker's on its internal port). `.dockerignore` keeps every `.env`, `.git`, `docs` and the other apps out. CI builds an image, without pushing it, on any pull request that changes its app or the packages it bundles. About 0.5 GB each, half of it Node.

### Deploys don't end work in progress
A deploy replaces the containers; a run lives in its worker's memory, so it can't move: the old worker has to finish it.
1. **Overlap (rolling update):** Coolify starts the new container, waits for its health check, then sends SIGTERM to the old one. The new worker takes new work at once; the old one takes nothing new and finishes what it's running. Stop and setup answers still reach it (they go through Redis), and its runs aren't reaped (it keeps renewing their locks).
2. **Grace period:** Coolify waits up to its Stop Grace Period before killing the old container. It's set to the maximum, **3600 seconds**.
3. **Everything ends within it:** a run or setup stops starting commands at 45 minutes; the one already running has its own 10-minute cap, and delivery takes about a minute, so all work ends by about 56 minutes.
4. **The server** gets the same rolling update. On SIGTERM it ends its open event streams; browsers reconnect, to the new server, from the last event they saw (`Last-Event-ID`).

Old and new code run side by side for a while, so every change has to work with the previous version:
- **Migrations are additive:** add a column or table, deploy, and remove the old one only in a later deploy. The new server migrates while the old worker may still be running.
- **Queue messages stay readable by the previous version:** add optional fields, never rename or remove one in the same deploy.

### Coolify settings
Two applications from this repository, each a Dockerfile build:

| Setting | api | worker |
|---|---|---|
| Base directory | `/` | `/` |
| Dockerfile | `apps/server/Dockerfile` | `apps/worker/Dockerfile` |
| Port | 4000, with the domain | none published |
| Health check | the image's (`/health` on 4000) | the image's (`/health` on 4100) |
| Stop Grace Period (Advanced → Operations) | 3600 | 3600 |
| Watch paths | `apps/server/**`, `packages/**`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` | `apps/worker/**`, `packages/**`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` |
| Container name | generated (a custom name turns rolling updates off) | generated |

Coolify uses a Dockerfile's `HEALTHCHECK` instead of the one in its dashboard. Ours run with `node`; the dashboard's would need `curl` or `wget`, which the images don't have, so it stays empty.

Environment variables are set per app in Coolify, from each app's `.env.example`, with three differences from local `.env` files:
- `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` goes on one line, with `\n` where the line breaks are; the apps turn them back into line breaks.
- `HOST` is left unset: the image sets `0.0.0.0`, and `localhost` would make the server reachable only inside its container.
- The worker sets `SANDBOX_PROVIDER=e2b` and `E2B_API_KEY` (local `.env` files default to `docker`).

Watch paths mean a change to the web app or the docs redeploys neither, and a server-only change leaves the worker, and its runs, alone.

### Capacity
How many runs execute at once is `WORKER_CONCURRENCY` per worker process (production: **8**); more wait in the queue, nobody is refused. Setups share the same slots. Four things cap it, and going past an outside limit fails runs instead of queueing them, so the setting must stay under the smallest:

| Limit | Today | When exceeded |
|---|---|---|
| **E2B concurrency** (sandboxes running at once, for the account) | Hobby: **20**, whatever their size. A run holds one sandbox and a setup two at once (its tries, then a fresh one for the final check). Pro ($150/month) raises it to 100 | Creating the sandbox is refused: the run fails, "Couldn't prepare the sandbox" |
| **The worker on the VPS** | Not measured. Estimate: 20–40 runs. Memory goes first: a long run holds 30–100 MB, and Node's heap stops at ~2.2 GB on an 8 GB machine unless `--max-old-space-size` is set. What limits it and the fixes towards 1,000 runs: [worker-capacity.md](./worker-capacity.md) | Out of memory, then slow event saving |
| **OpenAI rate limit** (tokens per minute for the account's tier) | Not checked | Calls are retried, then the run fails |
| **Daily spend cap** (`DAILY_SPEND_CAP_USD`, $5) | Roughly 10–25 runs a day | New tasks are refused with a clear message; nothing running fails |

So `WORKER_CONCURRENCY=8` fits E2B's Hobby plan: at most 16 sandboxes, if all 8 slots were setups. (On Daytona it would need Tier 2 or higher: Tier 1's 10 vCPU and 10 GiB fit only 2 sandboxes.) Signs it needs changing: runs often sitting at "Queued" (raise it, within E2B's limit); "Couldn't prepare the sandbox" (lower it, or move to Pro).

**Still to do:**
- **Measure the worker:** run it locally with the fake sandbox and scripted model from the tests (no sandbox provider, no OpenAI), push 10, 25 and 50 runs through at once, and record memory, the time to save events and database pool waits. That replaces the estimate above with numbers.
- **Check the OpenAI tier's tokens per minute** against 8 agents at once.
- **Wait instead of failing** when the provider refuses a sandbox for quota: today the run fails; it should go back to the queue or retry after a delay.

**Local dev:** `docker-compose` (Postgres, Redis) · `pnpm dev:web` / `dev:server` / `dev:worker` · `SANDBOX_PROVIDER=docker` (or `e2b` / `daytona` on their free credit) · webhooks via smee.io or cloudflared tunnel.
